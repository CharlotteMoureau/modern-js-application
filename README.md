# modern-js-application

This was a solo project carried out from the 08th to the 11th of March 2021 as part of the BeCode LiÃ¨ge's Junior Web Developer program. We were tasked to adapt our code from a [former project](https://github.com/CharlotteMoureau/character-manager-js) to fit the organisation of a "modern Js application". I chose to redo the design to fit my personal taste, using a Bootstrap base.

## Learning objectives

- [ ] be able to organize your code with multiple functions
- [ ] be able to organize your code in multiple files
- [ ] be able to use a package manager to import third-party libraries in your code
- [ ] be able to use linters and formatters to make your code cleaner and more bug-free
- [ ] be able to optimize your code to be shipped to a browser faster

## The mission:

> It's Monday morning. I sit at my desk, start the computer, and my two screens light up.
>
> I open up my text editor and the terminal in the first screen. I type two simple words in the terminal: `npm start` and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. A few seconds later a browser tab launches in the second screen with a local server where I can see the application as I develop it.
>
> I need to add a small new feature. I already have the code in my head, and start typing it out. Before I even save, a red squiggly line under a piece of recent code alerts me that there is a problem, and suggests a fix. I accept the fix, which is automatically applied to my code. Phew, that would have taken 30 minutes of my time to find and fix manually. And voilÃ , I'm good to go!
>
> I keep typing, instantly solve two more problems, and hit Save. I'm not the best at keeping my code tidy and well indented, but my text editor is set to auto-format the code on save. Awesome, I don't even have to think about it and there I have my variables well aligned, my functions well indented, my nested conditionals well laid out. It's so much easier to read now.
>
> I now see that I could organize my code a little better, and that I could add an additional explanation for future me in a comment. I save again.
>
> I glance at my second screen. I haven't touched a thing since hitting Save, but the tab is automatically reloading with the new code applied. I watch the app load under my eyes, and I can immediately test it. Wow. That was a breeze, the new feature works!
>
> I type `npm build` in the terminal and all my SASS and JS is bundled, optimized and minified, ready to ship to the browser with optimal performance. Development never felt better.
